ImportError: cannot import name '_deprecate_Xt_in_inverse_transform' from 'sklearn.utils.deprecation' (/home/maylis/Dokumente/m-h-machinelearning/.venv/lib64/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/utils/deprecation.py) Bitti fix

This error typically occurs due to version incompatibility between `scikit-learn` and other libraries or outdated code referencing removed internal functions. To fix this issue:

1. **Upgrade `scikit-learn`**: Ensure you are using the latest version of `scikit-learn`. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Check Dependencies**: If you are using libraries like `imblearn`, ensure they are compatible with your `scikit-learn` version. Update them as well:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade imbalanced-learn
   ```

3. **Avoid Internal Imports**: `_deprecate_Xt_in_inverse_transform` is an internal function and should not be directly imported. If your code or a library depends on it, check for updates or alternatives.

After upgrading, restart your Python environment and verify the issue is resolved.
